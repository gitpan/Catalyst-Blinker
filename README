Catalyst::Blinker - show a little X11 blinker while Catalyst is reloading

I'm developing under Catalyst and am using the Catalyst test server that
is running on my local machine and is relaoding every time I'm saving changes
to the source tree. This is a cool feature, but I have to wait in front of the
browser until the application is loaded full and can answer http requests; if I hit
F5 in the browser before it is up and running I get a failure and have to hit it
again. I got tired of this and made this little module, that notifies me if it's
safe or not to operate the app.

The thing is very primitive. While Catalyst app is loading, it blinks yellow. If
it has loaded ok, it shows green light for a couple of seconds and disappears.
If there was a failure (syntax failure in my case most of the time), it shows red
light which doesn't go away until the problem is fixed.
